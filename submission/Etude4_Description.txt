Etude 4 is a minimal, balanced watchface for Pebble/Rebble.

The main time header is displayed in 12h/24h format according to the user's system preferences.  The background and text colors are customizable. The bluetooth icon shows blue when connected, pale red when disconnected. When quiet time is activated, a mute icon is displayed. The status line provides the current battery charge, abbreviated day (MTWRFSU + day of month), and day's step count.
